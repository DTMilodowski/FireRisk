# This module estimates fire risk based on the Australian McArthur (Mark5) fire
# danger rating system. This is a relatively simple fire risk metric
# predominately determined by meteorological conditions. The original equations
# were published by Noble et al., Aust. J. Ecol., 1980.
#
# Note that the Mark5 index does not account for factors such as diversity in 
# the abundance or characteristics of fuel loads, or topographic slope, and is
# based on an empirical formulation of fire risk from Australia
#
# Meteorological variables required:
# - relative humidity, H
# - temperature, T
# - wind velocity, U
# - precipitation, P
# - number of days since previous rainfall event, d
# - Keetch-Byram drought index [Keetch & Byram, 1960], I
